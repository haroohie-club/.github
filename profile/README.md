# We're the Haroohie Translation Club!

Welcome to our GitHub organization!

Our repositories may seem a bit cluttered at first, but we have a method to this. There are five repos per
game work on:
* [GameName]TranslationAssets &ndash; Contains the assets (graphics, subtitles, fonts, miscellaneous binary files) for the game's patch; private until release.
* [GameName]TranslationBuild &ndash; Contains the build scripts & and ASM hacks for the game's patch; public.
* [GameName]TranslationStrings &ndash; Contains the all the strings (dialogue/script/UI) for the game & patch; private until release.
* [GameName]TranslationUtility &ndash; Contains the utility that we use to edit the game; always public and free to use!
* [GameName]TranslationRelease &ndash; The repository where we host the game's released patches.

For more information on what we're doing, checkout [our website](https://haroohie.club/). If you have
